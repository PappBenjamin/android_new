a repository acts like a "black box" function that provides data (e.g., user info or authentication results) to other parts of your app,
without exposing the messy details of where it comes from—like API calls, databases, or error handling.
This encapsulation is considered good practice because it keeps your code clean, modular, and easy to change or test later.
For example, in AuthRepository, methods like signIn return a Result<AuthResponseDto> without the caller needing to know about network requests or token management.
